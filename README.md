Smart City Weather (HK)

Modern, mobile-first weather dashboard for Hong Kong and beyond.

A Hong Kong weather dashboard that provides real-time conditions, hourly forecasts, and 7-day trends. The frontend adopts a glassmorphism design with responsive layouts, while the backend (Node.js/Express) aggregates data from the Open-Meteo API with caching, rate-limiting, and secure middleware.

This project serves as a portfolio showcase of my full-stack development skills, combining clean UI, API integration, and deployment on Render.

✨ Features

User Features

Real-time conditions: temperature, feels-like, humidity, wind speed, weather code

24-hour forecast: temperature + precipitation (Chart.js mixed line/bar chart)

7-day forecast: min/max temperatures, precipitation, and weather icons

Input city names or raw coordinates (22.3,114.17)

Default view: Central, Hong Kong (configurable in .env)

Responsive UI with dark, glass-like design

System Features

REST API: /api/weather?lat=...&lon=...&timezone=...

Caching: Node-Cache to reduce API calls

Rate Limiting: prevent misuse with express-rate-limit

Security: helmet headers, CORS configuration

Logging: HTTP logs via morgan

🧑‍💻 My Contributions

Designed and implemented Express routes and weather API adapter

Transformed raw Open-Meteo JSON into frontend-friendly data structures

Built the frontend using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS with responsive layouts and gradient design

Integrated Chart.js for interactive temperature/precipitation charts

Deployed on Render, configured environment variables for production

Focused on maintainability: modular JS, .env support, reusable components
